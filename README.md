TaskBoard
=========================

## Overview
This is a basic Task board built using the new Rally board. It will follow an iteration or release filtered page. It also provides a user filter. One limitation is that "Remaining Hours" can not be edited on the card at this time, however, dragging a card to the "Completed" column will set "Remaining Hours" to 0.
